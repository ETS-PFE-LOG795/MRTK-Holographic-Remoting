# Mixed Reality ToolKit (MRTK) Holographic Remoting

From Microsoft: [HoloLens 2 fundamentals: develop mixed reality applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/beginner-hololens-2-tutorials/)

Prototype build with the purpose of testing Holographic Remoting both in the Unity Player, as well as an executable application.

To run the Holographic Remoting feature in the Unity Player, open the panel under `Mixed Realtity / Remoting / Holographic Remoting for Play Mode`. The required IP address is available from the HoloLens companion app named Holographic Remoting Player, available directly from the store. Then, make sure the companion app is running, and enter Play mode in Unity.

To run the Holographic Remoting feature as an executable, simply build the app (shortcut `ctrl+shift+B`), launch it, and enter the HoloLens IP address in the field located in the top-left corner of the screen. The required IP address is available from the HoloLens companion app named Holographic Remoting Player, available directly from the store. Make sure this companion app is running when you enter playmode.
